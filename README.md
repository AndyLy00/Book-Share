# Book-Share
This will be a platform where users will rent different books from each other.

## Why Microservice Architecture is a good fit for my Book-Share Platform?

1. **Complexity and Modularity**: Microservices allow you to break down the application into smaller, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and maintained separately. For example, you can have microservices for user authentication, book listings, payments, reviews, and recommendation systems.

2. **Scalability**: Support many users at once. Microservices allow each part of your app (e.g., the search engine or recommendation system) to be scaled independently based on demand, without affecting other services.

3. **Easier Maintenance and Updates**: With microservices, updates can be deployed to individual services without requiring a full system-wide deployment, reducing downtime and minimizing the risk of introducing bugs into the entire system.

4. **Fault Isolation**: Microservices help with fault isolation. If one part of the app fails (e.g., the payment gateway), the rest of the system remains operational. This increases the overall resilience of your app.

## Real-World Examples of Microservices Usage

1. **Netflix**:
    - Netflix uses microservices to handle different aspects of streaming, recommendations, user preferences, and billing. Your app could similarly modularize different processes, such as tracking available books, handling payments, and matching users with potential rentals.

2. **Etsy**:
    - Etsy uses microservices to update features (such as product listings and seller tools) without affecting other areas of the platform.

## Service Boundaries:

- User Microservice:

  Works with users actions like Sign in and Sign up. Manage user roles and preferences.


- Book Microservice:

  Works with all information about books (Creating, Updating, Deleting and Showing).

}
```

#### Book Entity
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Title",
  "description": "Description",
  "author": "Author",
  "owner": "OwnerID",
  "price": 99.99,
  "category": ["Fantasy", "Drama"]
}
```

## Deployment and Scaling:
Fot this step I choose Docker. Docker helps developers build, share, run, and verify applications anywhere â€” without tedious environment configuration or management. Deployment and scaling are important because they make sure an app is available and works well for users. Deployment gets the app up and running, while scaling makes sure it can handle more users as it grows, keeping everything fast and reliable.
